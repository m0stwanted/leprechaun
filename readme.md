## About

## Installation and Launching

This application is a rather simple application of [Ratpack](https://ratpack.io/) Java Framework which produces
just one fat-jar. To install it from sources you just have to clone the stable version from the
repository and build it with `build.sh` script (Maven should be installed).

Maven build script will generate fat jar file named `leprecon-server.jar` which is almost all you need to start an application:

    java -jar target/leprecon-server.jar
	
The default port is `5060`. You may also customize ports, host, cache size and API prefix by editing
`app.properties` before compilation.
